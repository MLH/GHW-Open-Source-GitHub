<h1>Best Developer Experience Contribution on GitHub</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
At GitHub, we understand the power of community, collaboration, and the magic that happens when diverse minds and ideas unite. However, in this vast ecosystem, a notable challenge is the inconsistency of baseline community practices across various repositories. The absence or poor quality of READMEs, unclear contribution guidelines, lack of a code of conduct, and slow pull request review process are common issues. These gaps can create barriers to entry for potential new contributors but can be easily resolved.
<br><br>
In this challenge, we’re focusing on something close to home – enhancing GitHub repositories! Dive into READMEs, optimize repository structures, or supercharge workflows with GitHub Actions. Your mission is to elevate the developer experience of a GitHub repository.

<h2>Criteria:</h2>
